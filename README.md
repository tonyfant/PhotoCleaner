##  About This Project

How many times have you opened your gallery only to find it cluttered with screenshots, duplicate photos, or useless shots? This app was created to solve this problem in a **simple, fast, and free** way.

The functionality is inspired by dating apps:
* **Swipe right** to keep a photo.
* **Swipe left** to add it to the delete list.

No subscriptions, no ads, just an effective way to tidy up.

## Features

* **Intuitive Interface**: A simple swipe gesture to decide the fate of each photo.
* **100% Free**: No hidden costs or in-app purchases. The app is and will always be free.
* **Private and Secure**: The app processes photos directly on your device. No photos are uploaded to external servers.
* **Open Source**: The code is open to everyone. Feel free to contribute or check out how it works.
* **Lightweight and Fast**: Built with SwiftUI to ensure the best native experience on iOS.
